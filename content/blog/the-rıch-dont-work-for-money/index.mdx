# Lesson #1: The Rich Don’t Work for Money

I didn’t tell my poor dad I wasn’t being paid. He wouldn’t have
understood, and I didn’t want to try to explain something I didn’t
understand myself.

For three more weeks, Mike and I worked three hours every
Saturday for nothing. The work didn’t bother me, and the routine
got easier, but it was the missed baseball games and not being able
to afford to buy a few comic books that got to me.

Rich dad stopped by at noon on the third week. We heard his
truck pull up in the parking lot and sputter when the engine was
turned off. He entered the store and greeted Mrs. Martin with a hug.
After finding out how things were going in the store, he reached into
the ice-cream freezer, pulled out two bars, paid for them, and signaled
to Mike and me.

## Avoiding One of Life’s Biggest Traps

“Well, you boys had better start thinking. You’re staring at one of
life’s biggest lessons. If you learn it, you’ll enjoy a life of great freedom and security. If you don’t, you’ll wind up like Mrs. Martin and most of
the people playing softball in this park. They work very hard for little
money, clinging to the illusion of job security and looking forward to a
three-week vacation each year and maybe a skimpy pension after fortyfive years of service. If that excites you, I’ll give you a raise to 25 cents
an hour.”

“Good,” rich dad said softly. “Most people have a price. And they have a
price because of human emotions named fear and greed. First, the fear of being
without money motivates us to work hard, and then once we get that paycheck, greed or desire starts us thinking about all the wonderful things money can buy. The pattern is then set.”
