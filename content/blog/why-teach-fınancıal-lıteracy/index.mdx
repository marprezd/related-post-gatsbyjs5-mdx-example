# Rule #1: You must know the difference between an asset and a liability, and buy assets.

If you want to be rich, this is all you need to know. It is rule number
one. It is the only rule. This may sound absurdly simple, but most
people have no idea how profound this rule is. Most people struggle
financially because they do not know the difference between an asset
and a liability.

“Rich people acquire assets. The poor and middle class acquire
liabilities that they think are assets,” said rich dad.
When rich dad explained this to Mike and me, we thought he was
kidding. Here we were, nearly teenagers and waiting for the secret to
getting rich, and this was his answer. It was so simple that we stopped
for a long time to think about it.

“What is an asset?” asked Mike.

“Don’t worry right now,” said rich dad. “Just let the idea sink in.
If you can comprehend the simplicity, your life will have a plan and
be financially easy. It is simple. That is why the idea is missed.”
“You mean all we need to know is what an asset is, acquire them,
and we’ll be rich?” I asked.

Rich dad nodded his head. “It’s that simple.”
“If it’s that simple, how come everyone is not rich?” I asked.
Rich dad smiled. “Because people do not know the difference
between an asset and a liability.”

## How the Quest for a Financial Dream Turns into a Financial Nightmare

The classic story of hardworking people has a set pattern. Recently
married, the happy, highly educated young couple moves into one of
their cramped rented apartments. Immediately, they realize that they
are saving money because two can live as cheaply as one.
The problem is the apartment is cramped. They decide to save
money to buy their dream home so they can have kids. They now have
two incomes, and they begin to focus on their careers. Their incomes
begin to increase.
